[20:03:10] === FINAL FORECAST ===
[20:03:10] Question: What is the probability that China will initiate a military invasion of Taiwan before December 31, 2030?

[20:03:10] Probability: 35.5% [20.5% - 50.5%]
[20:03:10] Starting base rate: 10.0%
[20:03:10] Key drivers: Perceived International Deterrence, US and Allied Military Posture, Chinese Military Capability for Invasion
[20:03:10] Rationale: While the historical base rate for countries invading neighbors in the 20th and 21st centuries (10%; 5-15%) implies such events are relatively rare, several current factors shift the probability upward for the China-Taiwan context. The most influential parameters are the strong international deterrence perceived by China and the highly elevated US and allied military posture in the region, both pushing the odds higher due to increased regional tensions and explicit defense commitments to Taiwan. On the other hand, China's own political willingness for such a high-risk operation appears moderate, not extreme, and this tempers the overall risk. Chinese military capabilities are improving but do not decisively overcome the odds given the operational challenges of an amphibious invasion. Domestic stability in China is a neutral factor, adding little pressure to act aggressively. Weighing these together, I estimate a roughly 25% (13%-40%) chance of a Chinese military invasion attempt on Taiwan before the end of 2030—higher than the outside view base rate, but still an unlikely scenario given significant deterrence, risks, and uncertainties.

[20:03:24] === RED TEAM CHALLENGE ===
[20:03:24] Strongest objection: The core flaw in this forecast lies in the selection and application of the reference classes, along with parameter calibration. The forecast gives great weight to generic modern invasion events while underweighting unique features of the China-Taiwan situation: the extreme international scrutiny, Taiwan's geographic defensibility, nuclear backstop, and China's high sensitivity to economic disruption. Using post-1945 great-power/mature-industrial-state invasion attempts against well-defended, internationally-backed territories as the main reference class would have yielded much lower base rates. Further, both 'US/allied military posture' and 'international deterrence' parameters appear to be double-counted, exaggerating the perceived risk. Parameter interactions (i.e. how deterrence multiplies with economic stakes and nuclear deterrent) have not been correctly accounted for, leading to overestimation of invasion likelihood.
[20:03:24] Alternative estimate: 12.0% [5.0% - 22.0%]
[20:03:24] Key disagreements: Reference class should be invasions by major powers against well-defended, internationally backed territories post-1945 (e.g., Cuba, Berlin, South Korea, Israel/Egypt in 1973, Gulf War I, Ukraine/Russia 2022), which have far lower base rates than 'neighoring territory invasions' in general., Parameter estimates for US and allied posture and international deterrence are both high, but their log-odds shifts may be redundant and effectively double-count the same deterrent mechanisms., Insufficient discounting for deterrent factors such as nuclear escalation risk, decisive sanctions, and China’s vulnerability to economic retaliation—factors not present in most historical invasions., The forecast does not adequately reflect that China historically acts with high caution in the presence of major-power military risks, as seen with Vietnam, border standoffs with India, and restraint around the Senkaku Islands., Overconfidence reflected in the mid-range estimate: 35% is implausibly high for an event with massive, multidimensional deterrence and global consequences.
[20:03:24] Rationale: When we use a tighter post-World War II great-power reference class—where well-defended, internationally supported states are invaded by major rivals—the empirical invasion rate is far below 10%. Only the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, under very specific risk/expectation calculations, fits as a major outlier. The deterrent power of US security guarantees (whether formal or not) has proven robust in Europe, East Asia, and elsewhere, even during intense Cold War standoffs. China’s economy is highly dependent on global markets and uniquely vulnerable to financial/economic isolation; the regime’s internal legitimacy is not predicated on imminent Taiwan conquest but on prosperity and order. Parameter modeling should give more negative log-odds for major deterrence and economic risk factors, and avoid double-counting. Properly weighted, these push the likelihood below 15%, squarely in line with both outside historical precedent and local specifics.
