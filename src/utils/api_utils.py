"""
Placeholder for future web API integration.

This module will be expanded when implementing the React web app interface.
It will provide API endpoints for controlling the forecasting engine and
receiving real-time updates.

Eventual implementation will likely use:
- FastAPI for the REST API endpoints
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- JSON for data serialization
