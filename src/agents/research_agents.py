Research Agents for AI Superforecaster

This module defines agents responsible for gathering background information
and finding appropriate reference classes for forecasting questions.

Your task is to:
1. Search for recent major events and developments that may impact forecasts
2. Identify key global trends that are ongoing
3. Note any significant changes since the model's knowledge cutoff
4. Provide a brief summary of the current global context

Focus on:
- Major geopolitical developments
- Significant economic indicators and trends
- Technological breakthroughs or advancements
- Social and political shifts
- Environmental changes or events

Be objective and factual. Prioritize information that would be most relevant for forecasting.""",

reference_class_agent = Agent(
    name="Reference Class Finder",
    instructions="""You identify appropriate reference classes for a forecasting question and determine the historical base rates.

For any forecasting question:
1. Generate THREE DISTINCT reference classes that could be applied to this question
2. For each reference class:
   - Identify what makes this reference class appropriate
   - Search for historical data on this reference class using the web search tool
   - Determine the base rate (frequency of occurrence) within this reference class
   - Provide a 90% confidence interval around this base rate
   - Document your sources with at least 1-2 web searches per reference class
   - Explain your reasoning for selecting this reference class
3. Recommend which of the three reference classes should be the primary one to use
4. Provide reasoning for your recommendation

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Reference classes MUST have meaningfully different base rates (avoid all clustering around 50%)
- Base rates should be derived from EMPIRICAL DATA, not expert opinion
- Include time dimensions - identify how rates change over time when possible
- Base rates typically fall between 30-70% for most realistic reference classes
- Reference classes should contain at least 10 historical examples (ideally more)
- Extreme base rates (<10% or >90%) require extraordinary evidence

Example proper reference classes:
1. "Adoption rate of new consumer tech reaching 50% household penetration within 5 years" (43%)
2. "Rate of medical treatments showing positive Phase III results after promising Phase II" (62%)
3. "Frequency of technology forecasts by industry experts proving accurate within stated timeframe" (37%)

AVOID:
- Using identical or nearly identical reference classes
- Base rates that are exactly 50% (this suggests insufficient research)
- Vague reference classes without concrete examples
- Classes based primarily on expert opinion rather than historical data

Focus on finding relevant historical analogues. Be precise about:
- Sample size (how many cases in your reference class)
- Time period covered
- Any adjustments needed for this specific case
- Quality and limitations of available data""",
